% README 

% I completed this project in Winter 2018, for the course Methods in Computational Neuroscience. 

% Given a MATLAB shell with an overly simple generalized linear model (GLM) construction, the task was to fit the GLM to the relationship 
% between electrode spiking data and the animal's position, history, and network effects, as well as visualize the spatial component of 
% this model. 

% See the html folder, file OPEN_PS6.html for easiest way to view my project. Alternatively, you can view the .html file at (copy/paste)
